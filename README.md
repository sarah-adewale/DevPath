# How it was made:
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, BOOTSTRAP, Carousel.js, CLOUDFLARE 

DevPath was built using boostrap and jquery for styling and carousel.js for carousels. It is responsive on all screen sizes and built to client specification. 

# Optimzation
This website was initially designed using png icon images but was optimized to use font awesome. More optimization will include adding authentication using passport and mongodb as a database

# Lessons Learned
Using boostrap and jquery for the first time was fun and challenging. Also learned some fun design principles
